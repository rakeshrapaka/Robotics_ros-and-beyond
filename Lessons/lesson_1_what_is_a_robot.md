 # 🤖 Lesson 1: What Is a Robot?

Welcome to your first step into the world of robotics! In this lesson, you'll understand what a robot really is—without any jargon—and explore how it fits into your everyday world.

## 🧠 Core Idea
A **robot** is any machine that can:
1. **Sense** its environment
2. **Think/Process** that information
3. **Act** on it to achieve a goal

> If a machine can do all three, it’s a robot.

## 🚗 Everyday Analogy: "A Car With a Brain"
Think of a **self-driving car**:
- **Sensors** = Cameras, radar, GPS (eyes and ears)
- **Processor** = On-board computer (brain)
- **Actuators** = Motors, brakes, steering (muscles)
- **Power source** = Battery or fuel (like food)

A robot is just like that—**a smart machine that sees, thinks, and moves**.

## 📦 Robot Building Blocks
- **Body:** The physical frame (could be wheels, arms, or even a drone propeller)
- **Sensors:** For seeing, hearing, touching (camera, LIDAR, bump sensors)
- **Processor (Controller):** Makes decisions
- **Actuators:** Motors that move parts
- **Power Supply:** Battery or plug

## 🧰 Real-World Robot Examples
| Robot Type        | Example               | Task                        |
|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Industrial        | Welding arm            | Assemble cars               |
| Service           | Vacuum bot             | Clean floors                |
| Exploration       | Mars Rover             | Explore Mars surface        |
| Medical           | Da Vinci surgical arm  | Assist in surgeries         |
| Humanoid          | Pepper, Atlas          | Interaction, research       |

## 🔍 Not Everything That Moves Is a Robot
Is a microwave a robot?
- ❌ No — it doesn’t sense the environment or make decisions.

Is a motion-sensing light a robot?
- ✅ Yes-ish — it senses motion and responds, but it’s *barely* intelligent.

---

## 🧪 Exercise 1: Spot the Robot
Look around your home and find 3 objects.
For each, ask:
- Does it **sense**?
- Does it **decide**?
- Does it **act**?

If yes to all, it’s a robot. Record your answers in `/exercises/daily_robotic_observations.md`.

## ✅ Mini Quiz
1. What are the 3 key functions of a robot?
2. Is a remote-controlled car a robot?
3. Can you name one robot that explores and one that performs surgery?

---

## 🏁 Summary
- Robots = Sense + Think + Act
- They're machines built to perform tasks intelligently
- You already live in a world full of robots—you just didn’t label them yet!
