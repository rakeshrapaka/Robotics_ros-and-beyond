# 🦾 Lesson 2: Robot Anatomy – Sensors, Actuators & Controllers

Now that you understand *what* a robot is, let's dive into *what it’s made of*. Every robot is a team of tiny systems working together, like your own body.

## 🧠 Core Idea

A robot's body has three essential systems:

1. **Sensors** – to sense the world (like your eyes, ears, and skin)
2. **Controllers (Processors)** – to make decisions (like your brain)
3. **Actuators** – to move or act (like your muscles)

## 🏃‍♂️ Analogy: "Your Body as a Robot"

* **Sensors**: Eyes (camera), Skin (touch), Ears (microphone)
* **Controller**: Brain – processes inputs and plans action
* **Actuators**: Muscles – carry out the brain’s commands
* **Power Source**: Food = Battery for robots

> Just like your brain tells your hand to pick up a glass, a robot’s processor tells a motor to spin or a gripper to close.

## 🧩 Breakdown of Robot Components

### 🔍 Sensors

Robots need sensors to know:

* Where they are (GPS, encoders)
* What’s around them (camera, LIDAR, IR)
* What they’re touching (force/pressure sensors)

Types of Sensors:

* **Proprioceptive**: Internal state (e.g. motor position)
* **Exteroceptive**: External world (e.g. camera, LIDAR)

### 🧠 Controller (Processor)

* Small computer (like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or custom board)
* Receives data from sensors
* Makes decisions based on logic or AI

### 🔧 Actuators

* Move the robot’s body (motors, servos, hydraulic cylinders)
* Types:

  * **DC Motors**: Used in wheels, arms
  * **Servos**: Controlled motion, used in robotic arms
  * **Hydraulics**: High force, used in industrial bots

## ⚡ Power Source

* Battery: Lithium-ion, common in mobile robots
* AC Power: For industrial robots

## 🧪 Exercise 2: Build a Robot on Paper

Draw or imagine a robot that:

* Can see, move, and respond to an obstacle
  Then label:
* Where the sensors are (eyes?)
* What kind of controller it uses (brain?)
* What actuators it has (arms? wheels?)

Use this layout in your `/exercises/robot_design_sketches.md`

## ✅ Mini Quiz

1. What does a sensor do in a robot?
2. What’s the difference between a servo motor and a DC motor?
3. Which part of a robot is like the human brain?

---

## 🏁 Summary

* Robots sense (input), decide (process), and act (output)
* Sensors, controllers, and actuators work like eyes, brain, and muscles
* Power makes it all possible
