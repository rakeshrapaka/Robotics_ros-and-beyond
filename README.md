# 🤖 Robotics Learning Track

Welcome to my self-guided Robotics journey! This repository contains beginner-friendly, bite-sized lessons I've followed with the help of a personal tutor , designed to build deep understanding through analogies, practical thinking, and real-world exercises.

## 🧭 Why This Repo Exists

Unlike academic notes, this repo is my **exploration space**:
- To learn Robotics from the ground up
- To document core concepts using **simple, relatable analogies**
- To practice through **small exercises and reflections**
- To gradually build a **solid robotics mindset** ready for real-world applications

## 🧱 Learning Structure

Each lesson builds on the previous one and follows a consistent format:
1. **Concept Simplified** – No jargon. Just real-world meaning.
2. **Everyday Analogy** – Understand through daily life examples.
3. **Practical Exercise** – Something to do at home or digitally.
4. **Mini Quiz/Reflection** – Quick check to internalize.
